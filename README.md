# CODE Linter

Intended to provide an internal and external communication platform for the students and faculty of CODE University of Applied Sciences in form of a university newspaper.

CODE Linter will fill the role of long-form, curated content with high visibility.
Slack has the issue of not having a satisfactoy importance filter, leading to important announcements getting overlooked.
Notion has a terrible search function and does not allow for easy participation of the student body.

CODE Linter allows every CODE student to submit their articles for review, hoping to lead to a more democratic and transparent way of communication.
