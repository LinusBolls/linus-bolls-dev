### Generating google credentials

if you are not part of the CODE Linter team or want to test the app with a different google organization, you will want to

- navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials 
- create a project if you haven't already
- click '+ CREATE CREDENTIALS' at the top of the screen
- click 'OAuth client ID'
- select 'Web application' for 'Application type'
- add the same url you put for PUBLIC_SERVICE_URL in your ```.env``` (i.e. 'http://127.0.0.1:5173') to 'Authorized JavaScript origins'
- add the same url plus '/auth/callback/google' (i.e. 'http://127.0.0.1:5173/auth/callback/google') to 'Authorized redirect URIs'
- click 'SAVE'
- copy 'Your Client ID' and 'Your Client Secret' from the resulting popup window into your ```.env``` file

## Running locally

# run the app with hot module reload at http://127.0.0.1:5173
